The amount of content nowadays is enormous, and with more getting posted by the second, here are a few of my go-to sources I use for inspiration.

## Showcases:

- [GSAP Showcase](https://gsap.com/showcase/): The GSAP website curates exceptional implementations showcasing the power of its animation library. Beyond the inspiration, their documentation and forum provide valuable resources to bring those ideas to life in your projects.<br /><br />
- [Godly Website](https://godly.website/): Specializes in showcasing exceptional web design, from portfolios to landing pages. This website covers multiple categories.<br /><br />
- [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/): A well-respected platform highlighting cutting-edge web design and development. Every day, week, month, and year, a website gets selected with exceptional design, animations, or storytelling. Going through this archive will give you some inspiration.<br /><br />
- [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular): They are one of the leading destinations to find & showcase creative work and home to the world's best design professionals. Next to that, you can also find courses and jobs here!<br /><br />
- [PageCollective](https://pagecollective.com/): A wide variety of styling, companies, and designs, with many specific search terms like carousels, forms, and landing pages. Always nice to browse through!<br /><br />

## Portfolios/Agency Sites/Other:

- [Olivier Larose](https://blog.olivierlarose.com/): Olivier is a great mentor. His blog (and YouTube) inspire me every time he creates something. If you want to learn GSAP/Framer motion with NextJS, he is your go-to guy.<br /><br />
- [Arvin Lewis](https://arvinleeuwis.com/): Arvin always produces great websites. A theme I've noticed him using is infinite scrolling. He puts it to great use with his newest portfolio!<br /><br />

- [VaersaaGod](https://www.vaersaagod.no/en/): A Norwegian creative agency specializing in branding and digital experiences,
  a fun, minimal website with interesting scroll behavior.<br /><br />

- [Karina Sirqueira](https://karinasirqueira.com/): Fun, dynamic, colorful, horizontal scrolling, and most of all, a beautiful website.
  If you need inspiration regarding color use.<br /><br />
- [Shirakaba Studio](https://www.shirakaba.studio/): This studio is the design practice of Sara Ridky & Jimi Filipovski. A beautifully
  crafted design with vibrant colors and typography.<br /><br />
- [Gabriel Contassot](https://gabrielcontassot.com/): A French developer and creative coder showcasing why less is more. No nonsense,
  right to the point, and beautifully crafted.<br /><br />
